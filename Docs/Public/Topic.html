            <h1>CHESS</h1>
            <p>Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered board with 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid. The history of chess can be traced back nearly 1,500 years to its earliest known predecessor, called chaturanga, in India; its prehistory is the subject of speculation. From India it spread to Persia, where it was modified in terms of shapes and rules and developed into Shatranj. Following the Arab invasion and conquest of Persia, chess was taken up by the Muslim world and subsequently spread to Europe via Spain (Al Andalus) and Italy (Emirate of Sicily). The game evolved roughly into its current form by about 1500 CE.</p>
            <p> The primary goal is to checkmate the opponent's king. This means putting the king in a position where it is under attack and cannot escape capture.</p>

                    <h2 style="color: white;">Pieces</h2>
                    <p>Each player starts with 16 pieces:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="color: white;">1 King: The most important piece. It can move one square in any direction.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">1 Queen: The most powerful piece. It can move any number of squares diagonally, horizontally, or vertically.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">2 Rooks: Can move any number of squares horizontally or vertically.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">2 Bishops: Can move any number of squares diagonally.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">2 Knights: Move in an "L" shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicularly.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">8 Pawns: The least powerful pieces, but they are crucial for controlling the center of the board. They move forward one square at a time, except for their first move where they can move one or two squares.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li style="color: white;">Strategy: Chess is a game of deep strategic thinking. Players must plan their moves carefully, anticipate their opponent's actions, and develop winning plans.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">Tactics: Tactical maneuvers involve quick, often surprising moves that exploit weaknesses in the opponent's position.</li>
                        <li style="color: white">Psychology: Psychological factors like patience, focus, and the ability to handle pressure play a significant role.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
                <li>Players alternate turns moving one of their pieces according to specific rules.</li>
                <li>Capturing: A piece is captured when it is moved to the square occupied by an opponent's piece. The captured piece is removed from the board.</li>
                <li>Special Moves: There are special moves like castling (moving the king and a rook together) and en passant (capturing an opponent's pawn in a specific circumstance).</li>
