            <h1>Fundamentals of Informatic Engineering</h1>
            <p>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering" aims to provide a global vision of Computer Engineering in both
                academic and professional points of view. The course gives the students a grasp of the fundamentals on which this engineering is based (mathematics, physics, anthropology and ethics), the future professional careers and the role of a computer engineer in today's society. The course is divided in two parts. the first part addresses the theoretical foundations, while the second helps develop practical skills.</p>
